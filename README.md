==========
Bluz is a Development Kit (DK) that implements the Wiring language and talks to the [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) cloud through Bluetooth Low Energy. It can be accessed through a REST API and programmed from a Web IDE.

This app takes in files in the form of a URL and a device ID to flash the files to. The system then starts an update on the Particle cloud and status can be retreieved
